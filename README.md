#  Platter

Platter is a redeveloped/enhanced version of [Beefplate](https://github.com/discoliam/beefplate). Platter is a starting point for many web projects at [Beef](http://www.wearebeef.co.uk). It is a combination of lots of work by many people, compiled, put together and some parts written/re-written by [Craig Coles](http://www.craigcoles.co.uk).

## Usage

Platter is far from a finished product, but is aimed at being a neutral for the variety of projects that we take on. Platter and its predecessors have been used for apps built in Rails, Noodall, Wordpress, Drupal, Magento, Joomla and Static HTML sites. The following is a set of common tasks that need to be completed for each project. 

* Update the Year and Site Title Keywords in HTML pages (index/404 etc)
* Update Meta Data
* Add Google Analytics account code
* Update url paths for CSS / JS files (currently all relative)
* Remove comments and compress CSS and JS files
